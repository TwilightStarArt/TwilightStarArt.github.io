        <h1>Twilight's Design - May 25, 2025</h1>
        <hr>

        <p>This was originally a test blog to make sure the blogs were functional with this website. However, I don't want to remove this post in fear of breaking something, so instead I'll make this a rant about Twilight's design and how it's developed.</p>
        <p>(For clarity, “Twilight” also refers to the character in my pfp, who has her own backstory and lore at this point.)</p>

        <h2>1 - Original</h2>
        <a href="../images/originalTwilightSkin.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/originalTwilightSkin.png" alt=""></a>
        <p>The first iteration of Twilight was made when I wanted my own Minecraft skin, when I started playing on RLcraft's now Alpha Server in early 2020. I added the bow offhandedly since I saw a lot of girl skins on SkinDex had bows, though it ended up becoming one of the key design elements I wanted to keep for Twilight in every redesign.</p>
        <p>Originally when I made this skin, I made it with the intent of being “just a minecraft skin.” After a certain point, I started drawing this design and using it as my profile picture over discord, and it started becoming what I presented myself as. However, since this design was originally made “as a minecraft skin,” there were a couple of details that were inaccurate to me, that didn't quite make sense to be inaccurate. Regardless, Twi's main design remained mostly the same up until when I left during late 2022/early 2023.</p>

        <h2>2 - First Redesign</h2>
        <a href="../images/TwiDesgin2.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/TwiDesgin2.jpg" alt=""></a>
        <p>During the period I was gone, I fully intended to abandon TwilightStar as an alias, and by extension abandon Twilight's character and design. Though instead at some point, I wanted to redesign Twilight to be more accurate to me. I wanted a way for both the original and the newer designs to logically coexist. I eventually settled on Twilight using a fairy ring often and “hiding” inside a doll with the original design, and puppeting it with magic. The fairy-in-a-doll aspect was inspired by the Twilight teddy bear variant StarArtsy had made for <abbr title="Trinkets and Baubles (minecraft mod)">T&B</abbr> shortly before I had left, as well as the amount of time I spent with a fairy ring on the Alpha Server. The white markings on the sleeves were intended to resemble <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehndi" target="_blank">Mehndi</a>. I'm not all that much a fan of this design, as it's very busy. Though out of all the designs up until now, I like its atmosphere the best. Later iterations of her design couldn't really capture the “adventure” vibe that I quite liked. Around this point, the dress outfit also became a sort of “casual”/PJ outfit for Twilight (for mainly if she was alone or with close family).</p>

        <h2>3 - Mishmash Design</h2>
        <a href="../images/TwiDesgin3.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/TwiDesgin3.jpg" alt=""></a>
        <p>While I did intend on abandoning Twilight, I ended up returning fully right before the start of 2024. In February of that year, I redesigned Twilight again. This version didn't really have any direction beyond “combining cute outfits I saw on Pintrest.” I don't really like it XD its super nonsensical, removes the mendhi, and the hijab looks like pigtails. I don't really like the pigtails!</p>

        <h2>4 - Royal Fairy</h2>
        <a href="../images/TwiDesign4.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/TwiDesign4.png" alt=""></a>
        <p>Almost immediately I realized how UTTERLY TERRIBLE that design was and started throwing around ideas for a redesign (again). These next couple of designs, I tried to go with a more royal theming, as part of the story I was making was vaguely to do with Twilight being somehow a royal fairy (taking from T&B lore for inspiration) and also having a very large mana pool. I still haven't quite worked out the logic of the story, but it's what I've been going with. I also really liked the crown design in the cap from <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Leon" target="_blank">Leon's</a> design from Pokemon Sword and Shield, so the next couple of designs I stole- er, I mean borrowed that little detail. (I don't entirely know how or why I started implementing the masks. Just looked cool ig??) While this version has problems, I'm somewhat fond of it</p>
        <a href="../images/TwiDesgin5.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="../images/TwiDesgin5.jpg" alt=""></a>
        <p>I ended up sticking with this suit outfit for quite some time in comparison to the others. I never ended up using the princessy doll or the demon doll designs though. The demon doll I was considering experimenting with a side story with another character, but I ended up scrapping. (there is also a little tired me in the bottom left corner) (I am making chai) (full time engineering school is fun)</p>

        <a href="../images/TwiDesign6.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/TwiDesign6.png" alt=""></a>
        <p>This one didn’t last long. I liked the crown and the new mask, but its a little busy again. I did end up making a PNGTuber with this design (at the time of writing, I still use this when I stream!)</p>

        <h2>5 - Current</h2>
        <a href="../images/twiRefMay2025.png" target="_blank"><img src="../images/twiRefMay2025.png" alt=""></a>
        <p>Recently, I made a sketch I shared in a group chat for a newer design of Twilight. While it does remove the cap I was trying to hold onto for the previous few designs, this outfit kind of captured the “adventurey” vibe that I missed from the first redesign. This current iteration, I decided I would go with multiple simultaneous designs that would be used depending on the situation. Sure maybe it's a bit odd to have so many variants, but I can do what I want! For variant 2, I wanted to combine the formal suit outfit with some of the improvements of the newer black dress outfit. Variant 3 Ive been using for a while at this point, but never got around to including it in a reference sheet. I'm quite happy with how these newest outfits turned out! Variant 2 I was struggling with where the colors should go, but I think I've done it decently.</p>
